Many aspiring professionals consider pursuing an MBA to enhance their career opportunities, but the decision is influenced by various factors such as academic performance, work experience, and personal motivations. 
However, understanding which factors contribute the most to this decision can be challenging. 

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that helps individuals assess whether they should pursue an MBA based on:
    Undergraduate GPA or grade
    Years of work experience,
    Personal Attributes: Age, gender, and career aspirations,
    Career Goals ie the desired post-MBA role
By analyzing these factors, the model will predict whether an individual is likely to benefit from pursuing an MBA.
The solution will also provide data-driven insights through visualizations to help users understand the key drivers behind the prediction.

Tech Used include:
  Programming Languages: Python
  Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
  Data Visualization Libraries: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
  Web Application Framework: Streamlit
